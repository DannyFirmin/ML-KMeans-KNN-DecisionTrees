From the dataset acquired after completing **Section - B**, implement a `K-Means clustering algorithm` to help you cluster the dataset of customers on the basis of the movies they have rented from the DVD rental stores. Various attributes related to the movies such `rating`, `year`, `rental_rate` and `year` may be useful for this exercise. Another interesting attribute that you can look at is the `fulltext` of the movie. In terms of the customer details, you can look at which movies a customer has rented, and the total number of movies rented by a customer. After you've prepared your learning model, plot a **visualization** showing the different clusters. If you have used more than 2 features for your clustering, you are still expected to provide a visualization by reducing the dimensions into a 2D graph.\n",

The results show that we are overfitting the data and we suspected that some independent variables have multicollinearity to one another. So, we tried to find out by using the variance inflation factor method (VIF) which indicates the variables are not completely independent of each other if the result is over 10. We also find out that the VIF of feature 'amount' is over 27 which shows very serious multicollinearity. So, we re-ran K-Nearest Neighbours algorithms without the feature 'amount' and it got a score of 0.4 which is our final prediction. We also used the Cross-validation method to avoid overfitting."
