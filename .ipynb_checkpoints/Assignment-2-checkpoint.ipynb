Various attributes related to the movies such `rating`, `year`, `rental_rate` and `year` may be useful for this exercise. Another interesting attribute that you can look at is the `fulltext` of the movie. In terms of the customer details, you can look at which movies a customer has rented, and the total number of movies rented by a customer. After you've prepared your learning model, plot a **visualization** showing the different clusters. If you have used more than 2 features for your clustering, you are still expected to provide a visualization by reducing the dimensions into a 2D graph.\n",
